			<h3>Diamond</h3>
			<p><strong>April Birthstone</strong></p>
			<p><strong>History: </strong>Since ancient times, diamonds have been 
			admired objects of desire. Formed one hundred miles beneath the Earth’s 
			surface over a billion years ago, diamonds are the hardest gem of all. 
			Diamonds have a long history of folklore; some of which say diamonds 
			were created when bolts of lightning struck rocks, and others said the 
			gem possessed healing powers. For centuries, diamonds have been adorned 
			by women and men and regarded as the ultimate gift and a symbol of eternal 
			love. </p>
			<p>Today, diamonds are still admired all around the world.
			<a href="https://www.gia.edu/">GIA</a> created the first, and now globally 
			accepted standard for describing diamonds:
			<a href="http://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/4cs-diamond-quality/">Color, Clarity, 
			Cut, and Carat Weight</a>. Today, the <b>4C’s of Diamond Quality</b> 
			are the universal method for assessing the quality of any diamond, anywhere 
			in the world.</p>

			flourishing greenness–on their necks to symbolize eternal youth. </p>
			<p><b>Green</b> is the color of <b>Spring</b> and has long symbolized

			<p>The <b>deeper and more vivid the color of green, the more valuable

			<h3>Pearl</h3>
			<p><strong>June Birthstone</strong></p>
			<p><strong>History: </strong>In all of human history, mankind has admired, 
			even worshipped, pearls. Persian mythology called them “the tears of 
			the gods.” Ancient Chinese legend claims the moon holds the power to 
			create pearls, instilling them with its celestial glow and mystery.
			</p>
			<p>Pearls are <b>unique</b> because they are the only gemstone formed 
			within a <b>living creature</b>. Since natural pearls are rare and difficult 
			to recover from the ocean’s depths, man invented the technique of culturing 
			salt and freshwater pearls from mollusks carefully seeded with irritants 
			similar to those produced by nature. </p>
			<p>Cultured pearls come in many beautiful colors, from <b>pale cream</b> 
			and <b>white</b> to <b>rose, lilac, green, gold, gray,</b> and <b>black</b>. 
			There are four main types of cultured pearls: Akoya, South Sea, Tahitian, 
			and Freshwater each having unique qualities that separates them for 
			the other. </p>

			Rubies are available in a range of red hues from <b>purplish</b> and

			prefer the calming flashes of blues and greens; others love the bright

			<img alt="Marquise Cut" src="images/thumbs/cuts/marquise.jpg"> <br>
			<h3>Marquise</h3>
			<p>This <b>football</b> shaped cut is also known as Navette Cut. It 
			is a type of a modified brilliant cut, meaning it was cut to reflect 
			the most light and offer maximum sparkle and color. It’s important to 
			note that if a gem is cut too shallow, the light will pass through the 
			back of the gem thereby reducing its color and sparkle. Striving for
			<b>perfect symmetry</b> is another important factor in crafting Marquise 
			cut gemstones. The two end points must line up with each other precisely 
			and the two halves of the stone should be perfect copies of each other. 
			This will ensure that the stone sits properly in its setting, minimizing 
			future chipping or breakage. The Marquise cut diamond was commissioned 
			by <b>King Louis XIV of France</b> to present to his love, Marquise 
			de Pompadour. With its long lines and elongated silhouette, it was supposed 
			to resemble her perfectly shaped smile. Furthermore, its elongated shape 
			flatters the finger, making it appear longer and slimmer. In recent 
			years, the Marquise cut has even been set vertically.</p>

			<h3>Princess</h3>
			<p><b>Square in shape</b>, this cut is the second most popular cut, 
			right behind the Round Brilliant cut. Actually, it is technically known 
			as "Square modified brilliant", since it is basically a square version 
			of the Round Brilliant cut. It boasts between 58 to 76 facets that bounce 
			light off its surface beautifully, making it a shape with the <b>most 
			sparkle</b>. Its positive attributes are best brought out by light, 
			transparent gemstones. It is a fairly recent cut, having been created 
			in the 1979 by Ygal Perlman, Betzalel Ambar and Israel Itzkowitz of 
			Israel. However, the Princess cut precursor, or the Profile cut was 
			created by <b>Arpad Nagy of London, in 1961</b>. A princess cut gem 
			with the same width in the diameter as a round cut gem will actually 
			have a higher carat weight, because the round cut gem would have had 
			its four corners cut off to make it round. The square cut gem retains 
			80% of the rough gemstone, while the round cut gem retains only 50%, 
			making it an excellent value for customers and gem cutters alike.</p>

			<h3>Pear</h3>
			<p>Shaped of a gleaming <b>teardrop</b>, a Pear cut gemstone can be 
			described as a hybrid between an <b>Oval cut and a Marquise</b> cut 
			with a tapered point on one end. It is a type of a modified Round Brilliant 
			cut and therefore offers 71 facets which reflect light beautifully and 
			allow color to showcase dramatically. The first Pear cut diamond was 
			crafted by a <b>Flemish polisher Louis van Berquem of Belgium in 1458</b>. 
			When crafting a Pear cut gemstone, it is important to aim for perfect 
			symmetry. The point should align with the peak of the rounded end. Pear 
			cut gemstones require a special 6 prong setting, with a prong to maintain 
			support for its fragile point. Most women wear the pointed end of the 
			Pear cut gemstone in the direction of the fingernail, although that 
			largely depends on the wearer’s choice. The elongated silhouette of 
			a Pear cut ring lengthens and slims its wearer’s finger, making it an 
			attractive choice not only for earrings and pendants, but for rings 
			as well.</p>

			shapes. Crafted with 69 facets, it is a type of a modified brilliant 
			cut, which offers its wearer the brilliance and fire of a round cut 
			gemstone, in a more unique shape. Its elongated silhouette is an added

			<h3>Brilliance</h3>
			<p>Alternatively known as "Round Brilliant", "American Ideal" or "American 
			Standard". With 57 facets, this cut is the most efficient in capturing 
			a stone’s brilliance and sparkle. Although there is no single inventor 
			officially responsible for the round cut invention, many sources name
			<b>Vincenzio Perruzzi, a Venetian cutter from the 18th century</b>. 
			The round cut has undergone many, many transformations over the years 
			in an effort to manipulate the facets in the best way possible to optimize 
			the dispersion of light in a stone. The most notable "Tolkowsky Cut", 
			developed by a Polish mathematician Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919. Tolkowsky 
			obtained his PhD from the University of London on the topic of the round 
			brilliant diamond cut, firmly establishing himself as the father of 
			the modern round cut. His book, The Diamond Design, is used as a benchmark 
			for diamond cutting in North America. He is credited with coining the 
			terms brilliance, fire and sparkle when it comes to evaluating and grading 
			diamonds. Originally developed exclusively for diamonds, the Round Brilliant 
			cut is now widely used for gemstones as well.</p>

			<h3>Emerald</h3>
			<p>The Emerald Cut is shaped like a <b>rectangle from the top, with 
			trimmed corners</b>. With approximately 50 facets, this particular cut 
			presents with fewer facets than Round or Square cuts. The emphasis here 
			is not so much on the sparkle, but on the gem’s <b>clarity and color</b>. 
			Color tends to show very vividly in Emerald cut gemstones. In lighter 
			colored gemstones, this cut can be quite dazzling with broader and more 
			striking flashes of light, with the light bouncing between the light 
			and dark surfaces of the gem, as if looking into a hall of mirrors. 
			This cut was originally designed for cutting emeralds. Since emeralds 
			occur in nature with numerous inclusions, cutting them is especially 
			difficult due to potential chipping. The Emerald cut addressed those 
			issues by decreasing the amount of force applied during cutting and 
			protecting the stone from breakage. Eventually, this cut was used for 
			diamonds and other gemstones as well. Customers were particularly drawn 
			to this unique and stylish newer style, as its elongated shape looks 
			particularly flattering on a finger.</p>
